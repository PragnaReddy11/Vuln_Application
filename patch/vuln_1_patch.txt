# Step 1: Delete the line containing hardcoded ADMIN_PASSWORD from app.py 
# (`gedit app.py`)

# Step 2: Modify the line comparing user's password retrieved from DB with
# ADMIN_PASSWORD to below
- role = "admin" if user["password"] == ADMIN_PASSWORD else "student"
+ role = "admin" if user["is_admin"] else "student"

# Step 3: Modify the version of base image to 1.0.1 in Dockerfile to use a DB
# with new admin credentials (`gedit Dockerfile`).
